#### For every new feature and bug fix you must create a new branch from the latest version of the **_master_** branch

### Naming Convension
If the branch is for a new feature, the branch should start with **feature/**, similarly for a bug it should start with  **bug/**.

#### Feature Branches
- If the feature branch only contains a UI change add the part **_ui_**, then the name should look like **feature/ui**, similarly if it contains only an integration from the backend use the word **_integration_**.
- If the branch contains both the UI and the integration no need to add anything after **_feature/_**.
